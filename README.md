# Front end NC NEWS project 
This project is a web application built using React.js that allows users to explore and interact with a variety of articles. The key features of the application include:

**Topic Filtering**: The app allows users to filter articles by topic, making it easy to narrow down their search and focus on a particular subject.

**Sorting Options**: Users can sort articles in ascending and descending order based on different criteria such as date, comment count, and votes. This feature helps users find the most relevant and popular articles.

**Commenting**: Users have the ability to post comments on articles, allowing them to engage in discussions and share their thoughts on the content.

**Comment Deletion**: Users can delete comments, but only if the comment belongs to them, giving them control over their own contributions.

I also used Axios to make requests to the API i had built previously. This ensures smooth communication between the front end and back end, resulting in a responsive user experience.
